# Microring-resonator-design-with-an-agile-and-accurate-simulation-method
In this Project, several simulation methods and example files for silicon photonic applications are provided, including
1. FDTD simulation for whispering-gallery modes resonance calculation, the example file is based on Lumerical
2. 
3. 










More details of the background and fundemental knowledge is covered in my thsis. Link will be available when University uploads it in the database. 

The author would like to thank the help from Lumerical Knowledge Exchange (https://kx.lumerical.com/), and I learnt a lot from book 'Silicon photonics design: from devices to systems' by Lukas Chrostowski
